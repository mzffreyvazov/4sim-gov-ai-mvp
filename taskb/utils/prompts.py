ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert Data Scientist and a master of data storytelling. 
Your primary skill is to look at any dataset and instantly identify the most compelling stories that can be told through visualizations. 
You think critically about the data, considering potential relationships, distributions, comparisons, compositions, and trends over time. 
Your suggestions must be modern, clear, and insightful, leveraging the capabilities of libraries like Seaborn.

Your mission is to analyze the provided dataset context and propose diverse {num_suggestions} visualizations that tell a coherent story about the data. Your suggestions must be a complete blueprint that an automated tool can use to generate the charts directly.

**CRITICAL: You MUST only use the exact column names that exist in the dataset. The available columns are: {df_columns}**

**Full Dataset Context:**
- **Shape (Rows, Columns):** {df_shape}
- **Column Names:** {df_columns}
- **Schema (dtypes and non-null counts):**
{df_info}
- **Statistical Summary:**
{df_description}
- **Data Sample (first 20 rows):**
{df_head}

**Your Analysis Process & Structure:**
Your response must follow a logical narrative. Start with broad overviews and then drill down into more specific, complex relationships. Structure your suggestions into these categories:
1.  **Foundational Distributions & Overviews.**
2.  **Core Relationships & Comparisons.**
3.  **Multivariate & Deep-Dive Insights.**

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS for Output:**
For each of the chart suggestions, provide the following details in a clear, structured format. Follow this template precisely for each suggestion:

---
**1. Chart Suggestion Title:** (A concise, descriptive title, e.g., "Age Distribution of Medal-Winning vs. Non-Winning Athletes")
*   **The Question it Answers:** (A clear, one-sentence analytical question, e.g., "Is there a significant difference in the age distribution between athletes who won a medal and those who did not?")
*   **Chart Type:** (The single most appropriate chart type from Seaborn, e.g., "Box Plot" or "Violin Plot".)
*   **Data Pre-processing/Aggregation (if any):** (A brief, clear description of any data manipulation required *before* plotting. If none, state "None".)
*   **Column Mapping (Seaborn style):**
    *   **X-Axis:** [MUST be an exact column name from {df_columns}]
    *   **Y-Axis:** [MUST be an exact column name from {df_columns} or None if not applicable]
    *   **Color/Hue (Optional):** [MUST be an exact column name from {df_columns} or None]
    *   **Facet (Optional):** [MUST be an exact column name from {df_columns} or None]
*   **Rationale and Insight:** (A brief explanation of why this chart is valuable and what specific patterns it might reveal.)
---
**(Repeat the above structure for all suggestions)**

**REMEMBER: Every column name you reference MUST exist exactly in this list: {df_columns}. Do not create new column names or use descriptive text as column names.**

CODE_GEN_TEMPLATE = """You are an elite Python data scientist and a Seaborn specialist. Your sole focus is on writing clean, direct, and executable code for data visualization using the Seaborn library. Your code must run without any modifications and produce a publication-quality chart.

**CONTEXT**:
- A pandas DataFrame named `df` is already loaded and available.
- The following libraries and variables are pre-imported and available: `pd`, `plt`, `sns`, `io`, `img_buffer`.
- **DataFrame Schema Context**:
    - Columns Available: {df_columns}
    - Data Types & Nulls: {df_info}
    - Statistical Summary: {df_description}

**TASK**:
- **Goal**: Write Python code using Seaborn to generate a '{chart_type}'.
- **Title**: The chart should be titled '{title}'.
- **Insight**: This chart is intended to answer: "{question}"
- **Data Pre-processing Steps**: {pre_processing_steps}
- **Column Mapping**: {column_mapping}

**SEABORN-CENTRIC CODE GENERATION LOGIC**:
- Use `sns.histplot`, `sns.countplot`, `sns.barplot`, `sns.scatterplot`, `sns.boxplot`, `sns.violinplot`, `sns.lineplot`, `sns.heatmap` as appropriate.
- Always use the `data` parameter in Seaborn plots (e.g., `sns.histplot(data=df_copy, ...)`).
- For heatmaps, the pre-processing step must create a suitable correlation matrix or pivot table.

**MANDATORY CODE STRUCTURE**:
1.  `sns.set_theme(style="whitegrid", palette="muted")`
2.  `df_copy = df.copy()`
3.  # **Pre-processing Block**: Implement the exact data pre-processing steps described. If 'None', this block can be empty.
4.  `fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))`
5.  # **Plotting Block**: The single Seaborn plotting command.
6.  `ax.set_title('{title}', fontsize=16, weight='bold')`
7.  Set appropriate xlabel and ylabel.
8.  If the x-axis has many categorical labels, use `plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')`.
9.  `fig.tight_layout()`
10. `fig.savefig(img_buffer, format='png', dpi=150, bbox_inches='tight')`
11. `plt.close(fig)`

**CRITICAL RULES**:
- **NO FUNCTIONS, IMPORTS, COMMENTS (except in the designated blocks), or MARKDOWN**.
- **DIRECT CODE ONLY**: Your entire output must be executable Python.
- **LEVERAGE SEABORN**: Use Seaborn functions and their parameters (`x`, `y`, `hue`, `data`) as the primary method for plotting.

Produce the Python code now.

CSV_FORMATTING_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert data processing specialist with deep knowledge of CSV file structures, particularly those from government statistical agencies and similar sources. Your task is to analyze and reformat unstructured CSV data into a clean, standardized format suitable for data analysis.

**YOUR MISSION:**
Transform the provided raw CSV data into a properly structured format by:
1. Identifying and flattening multi-level headers
2. Cleaning and standardizing column names
3. Extracting and organizing data rows
4. Handling missing values appropriately
5. Ensuring the output is analysis-ready

**DETAILED PROCESSING RULES:**

**1. HEADER ANALYSIS & FLATTENING:**
- Identify header rows at the top of the data (usually 1-3 rows)
- For multi-level headers: concatenate header levels using underscore (_) separator
- Example: "Population" + "Male" + "2023" becomes "Population_Male_2023"
- Trim all whitespace from header components
- Ensure each column has a unique, descriptive name
- If headers are unclear, create meaningful names based on data content

**2. COLUMN NAME STANDARDIZATION:**
- Remove special characters except underscores
- Convert to snake_case format (lowercase with underscores)
- Make names descriptive and analysis-friendly
- Remove line breaks and hyphens within words
- Combine hyphenated words into single words (e.g., "heyvan-darlıq" → "heyvandarliq")
- Use meaningful English translations or transliterations when possible
- Examples:
  - "GDP (millions USD)" → "gdp_millions_usd"
  - "Population - Total" → "population_total"
  - "2023 Q1" → "q1_2023"
  - "heyvan-darlıq" → "heyvandarliq"
  - "bitki-çilik" → "bitkicilik"
- First column should typically be named based on its content (e.g., "region", "category", "year", "identifier")

**3. DATA ROW PROCESSING:**
- Identify where actual data begins (after header rows)
- Extract all data rows maintaining original values
- Preserve numerical precision exactly as provided
- Keep text identifiers verbatim

**4. MISSING VALUE HANDLING:**
- Empty cells: leave blank in CSV
- Dash (-), ellipsis (...), "n/a", "N/A": convert to empty cells
- Other placeholder values: convert to empty cells if they clearly indicate missing data
- Preserve zeros (0) as actual values, not missing data

**5. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Return ONLY the clean CSV data
- First row must contain the final column headers
- Subsequent rows contain the data
- Use comma separators
- Ensure proper CSV escaping for text containing commas
- No explanations, no markdown formatting, no additional text
- Must be syntactically valid CSV that can be directly parsed

**6. DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE:**
- Verify all rows have the same number of columns
- Ensure numerical data maintains proper formatting
- Check that identifiers are preserved exactly
- Confirm headers are unique and descriptive

**EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION:**

Input (messy multi-header CSV):
```
,Economic Indicators,Economic Indicators,Population Data,Population Data
,GDP,Inflation,Total,Growth Rate
Region,2023,2023,2023,2023
Baku,45.2,8.5,2.3M,1.2%
Ganja,12.1,7.8,0.5M,0.8%
```

Output (clean CSV):
```
region,gdp_2023,inflation_2023,population_total_2023,population_growth_rate_2023
Baku,45.2,8.5,2.3M,1.2%
Ganja,12.1,7.8,0.5M,0.8%
```

**AZERBAIJANI TEXT HANDLING:**
For Azerbaijani text, clean and standardize as follows:
- "heyvan-darlıq" → "heyvandarliq" (remove hyphens, combine words)
- "bitki-çilik" → "bitkicilik" (remove hyphens, combine words)
- "Cəmi" → "cemi" or "total" (transliterate or translate)
- Keep regional names as-is but clean formatting
- Remove line breaks within words
- Convert to lowercase and snake_case format

**RAW CSV DATA TO PROCESS:**
{raw_csv_data}

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
Analyze the above raw CSV data and return the cleaned, formatted version following all the rules specified. Return ONLY the formatted CSV data - no explanations or additional text.
