ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert Data Scientist and a master of data storytelling. 
Your primary skill is to look at any dataset and instantly identify the most compelling stories that can be told through visualizations. 
You think critically about the data, considering potential relationships, distributions, comparisons, compositions, and trends over time. 
Your suggestions must be modern, clear, and insightful, leveraging the capabilities of libraries like Seaborn.

Your mission is to analyze the provided dataset context and propose diverse {num_suggestions} visualizations that tell a coherent story about the data. Your suggestions must be a complete blueprint that an automated tool can use to generate the charts directly.

**CRITICAL: You MUST only use the exact column names that exist in the dataset. The available columns are: {df_columns}**

**Full Dataset Context:**
- **Shape (Rows, Columns):** {df_shape}
- **Column Names:** {df_columns}
- **Schema (dtypes and non-null counts):**
{df_info}
- **Statistical Summary:**
{df_description}
- **Data Sample (first 20 rows):**
{df_head}

**Your Analysis Process & Structure:**
Your response must follow a logical narrative. Start with broad overviews and then drill down into more specific, complex relationships. Structure your suggestions into these categories:
1.  **Foundational Distributions & Overviews.**
2.  **Core Relationships & Comparisons.**
3.  **Multivariate & Deep-Dive Insights.**

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS for Output:**
For each of the chart suggestions, provide the following details in a clear, structured format. Follow this template precisely for each suggestion:

---
**1. Chart Suggestion Title:** (A concise, descriptive title, e.g., "Age Distribution of Medal-Winning vs. Non-Winning Athletes")
*   **The Question it Answers:** (A clear, one-sentence analytical question, e.g., "Is there a significant difference in the age distribution between athletes who won a medal and those who did not?")
*   **Chart Type:** (The single most appropriate chart type from Seaborn, e.g., "Box Plot" or "Violin Plot".)
*   **Data Pre-processing/Aggregation (if any):** (A brief, clear description of any data manipulation required *before* plotting. If none, state "None".)
*   **Column Mapping (Seaborn style):**
    *   **X-Axis:** [MUST be an exact column name from {df_columns}]
    *   **Y-Axis:** [MUST be an exact column name from {df_columns} or None if not applicable]
    *   **Color/Hue (Optional):** [MUST be an exact column name from {df_columns} or None]
    *   **Facet (Optional):** [MUST be an exact column name from {df_columns} or None]
*   **Rationale and Insight:** (A brief explanation of why this chart is valuable and what specific patterns it might reveal.)
---
**(Repeat the above structure for all suggestions)**

**REMEMBER: Every column name you reference MUST exist exactly in this list: {df_columns}. Do not create new column names or use descriptive text as column names.**
"""

CODE_GEN_TEMPLATE = """You are an elite Python data scientist and a Seaborn specialist. Your sole focus is on writing clean, direct, and executable code for data visualization using the Seaborn library. Your code must run without any modifications and produce a publication-quality chart.

**CONTEXT**:
- A pandas DataFrame named `df` is already loaded and available.
- The following libraries and variables are pre-imported and available: `pd`, `plt`, `sns`, `io`, `img_buffer`.
- **DataFrame Schema Context**:
    - Columns Available: {df_columns}
    - Data Types & Nulls: {df_info}
    - Statistical Summary: {df_description}

**TASK**:
- **Goal**: Write Python code using Seaborn to generate a '{chart_type}'.
- **Title**: The chart should be titled '{title}'.
- **Insight**: This chart is intended to answer: "{question}"
- **Data Pre-processing Steps**: {pre_processing_steps}
- **Column Mapping**: {column_mapping}

**SEABORN-CENTRIC CODE GENERATION LOGIC**:
- Use `sns.histplot`, `sns.countplot`, `sns.barplot`, `sns.scatterplot`, `sns.boxplot`, `sns.violinplot`, `sns.lineplot`, `sns.heatmap` as appropriate.
- Always use the `data` parameter in Seaborn plots (e.g., `sns.histplot(data=df_copy, ...)`).
- For heatmaps, the pre-processing step must create a suitable correlation matrix or pivot table.

**MANDATORY CODE STRUCTURE**:
1.  `sns.set_theme(style="whitegrid", palette="muted")`
2.  `df_copy = df.copy()`
3.  # **Pre-processing Block**: Implement the exact data pre-processing steps described. If 'None', this block can be empty.
4.  `fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))`
5.  # **Plotting Block**: The single Seaborn plotting command.
6.  `ax.set_title('{title}', fontsize=16, weight='bold')`
7.  Set appropriate xlabel and ylabel.
8.  If the x-axis has many categorical labels, use `plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')`.
9.  `fig.tight_layout()`
10. `fig.savefig(img_buffer, format='png', dpi=150, bbox_inches='tight')`
11. `plt.close(fig)`

**CRITICAL RULES**:
- **NO FUNCTIONS, IMPORTS, COMMENTS (except in the designated blocks), or MARKDOWN**.
- **DIRECT CODE ONLY**: Your entire output must be executable Python.
- **LEVERAGE SEABORN**: Use Seaborn functions and their parameters (`x`, `y`, `hue`, `data`) as the primary method for plotting.

Produce the Python code now.

CSV_FORMATTING_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert data processing specialist with deep knowledge of CSV file structures, particularly those from government statistical agencies and similar sources. Your task is to analyze and reformat unstructured CSV data that may contain ONE OR MULTIPLE data tables.

**YOUR MISSION:**
Analyze the raw CSV data to detect if it contains single or multiple tables, then format accordingly.

**MULTI-TABLE DETECTION RULES:**
1. Look for clear descriptive title rows that indicate DISTINCT datasets (e.g., "18.1 Ümumi istifadədə olan sabit şəbəkə telefonlarının sayı")
2. Identify major sections separated by 3+ empty rows or clear topic changes
3. Each table should have:
   - A descriptive title or heading
   - Its own complete header row structure
   - Multiple rows of actual data (minimum 2-3 data rows)
   - Consistent data structure within the table
4. **AVOID OVER-SPLITTING**: Do not create separate tables for:
   - Different time periods in the same dataset (combine into one table with time columns)
   - Sub-categories or breakdowns of the same metric
   - Related data that logically belongs together
5. **MINIMUM TABLE SIZE**: Each table should have at least 3 rows of actual data
6. **MAXIMUM TABLES**: Limit to maximum 3-4 tables unless clearly distinct datasets exist

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

**IF SINGLE TABLE DETECTED:**
Return the formatted CSV as normal with clean headers and data.

**IF MULTIPLE TABLES DETECTED:**
Return in this exact format:
```
TABLE_1_TITLE: [descriptive title extracted from the data]
[formatted csv data for table 1]

TABLE_2_TITLE: [descriptive title extracted from the data]
[formatted csv data for table 2]

TABLE_3_TITLE: [descriptive title extracted from the data]
[formatted csv data for table 3]

[... continue for all detected tables]
```

**DETAILED PROCESSING RULES:**

**1. TITLE EXTRACTION:**
- Extract meaningful titles from descriptive rows
- Clean and standardize titles (remove special formatting)
- Make titles concise but descriptive
- Example: "18.1 Ümumi istifadədə olan sabit şəbəkə telefonlarının sayı, min nömrə" → "Fixed Network Telephones Count (thousands)"

**2. HEADER ANALYSIS & FLATTENING:**
- Identify header rows for each table (usually after title and empty rows)
- For multi-level headers: concatenate using underscore (_) separator
- Trim all whitespace from header components
- Ensure each column has a unique, descriptive name

**3. COLUMN NAME STANDARDIZATION:**
- Remove special characters except underscores
- Convert to snake_case format (lowercase with underscores)
- Remove line breaks and hyphens within words
- Combine hyphenated words into single words (e.g., "heyvan-darlıq" → "heyvandarliq")
- Use meaningful English translations or transliterations when possible
- Examples:
  - "GDP (millions USD)" → "gdp_millions_usd"
  - "Population - Total" → "population_total"
  - "2023 Q1" → "q1_2023"
  - "heyvan-darlıq" → "heyvandarliq"
  - "bitki-çilik" → "bitkicilik"
- First column should typically be named based on its content (e.g., "country", "region", "category")

**4. DATA ROW PROCESSING:**
- For each table, identify where actual data begins (after title and header rows)
- Extract all data rows maintaining original values
- **CRITICAL: Ensure ALL rows have the SAME number of fields as the header**
- If a data row has fewer fields than the header, pad with empty cells
- If a data row has more fields than the header, truncate to match header length
- Preserve numerical precision exactly as provided
- Keep text identifiers verbatim
- Remove any extra commas that create empty trailing fields

**5. FIELD COUNT CONSISTENCY:**
- Count the number of columns in your header row
- Ensure EVERY subsequent data row has exactly the same number of comma-separated fields
- Example: If header has 5 columns, every data row must have exactly 4 commas (creating 5 fields)
- Remove trailing commas that create empty fields beyond the header count
- Pad short rows with empty cells to match header length

**5. MISSING VALUE HANDLING:**
- Empty cells: leave blank in CSV
- Dash (-), ellipsis (...), "n/a", "N/A": convert to empty cells
- Other placeholder values: convert to empty cells if they clearly indicate missing data
- Preserve zeros (0) as actual values, not missing data

**6. FIELD COUNT VALIDATION:**
- After processing each table, verify that every row has the same number of fields
- Count commas in each row - should be (number_of_columns - 1)
- Fix any rows with inconsistent field counts before outputting

**7. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
- For each table: first row contains clean column headers, subsequent rows contain data
- Use comma separators
- Ensure proper CSV escaping for text containing commas
- No explanations, no markdown formatting around CSV data itself
- Must be syntactically valid CSV that can be directly parsed

**AZERBAIJANI TEXT HANDLING:**
For Azerbaijani text, clean and standardize as follows:
- "heyvan-darlıq" → "heyvandarliq" (remove hyphens, combine words)
- "bitki-çilik" → "bitkicilik" (remove hyphens, combine words)
- "Cəmi" → "total" (translate common terms)
- "nisbətən" → "compared_to" (translate when meaningful)
- Keep regional/country names as-is but clean formatting
- Remove line breaks within words
- Convert to lowercase and snake_case format

**EXAMPLE MULTI-TABLE TRANSFORMATION:**

Input:
```
,"Overall Statistics Report"
,
,"Table 1: Population Data"
,
,Country,2020,2021,2022
,Azerbaijan,10.1,10.2,10.3
,
,"Table 2: GDP Growth %"
,
,Country,2020,2021,2022
,Azerbaijan,5.1,5.2,5.3
```

Output:
```
TABLE_1_TITLE: Population Data
country,population_2020,population_2021,population_2022
Azerbaijan,10.1,10.2,10.3

TABLE_2_TITLE: GDP Growth Percentage
country,gdp_growth_2020,gdp_growth_2021,gdp_growth_2022
Azerbaijan,5.1,5.2,5.3
```

**RAW CSV DATA TO PROCESS:**
{raw_csv_data}

**CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES:**

1. **ONLY USE DATA FROM THE INPUT**: You must ONLY process and reformat data that actually exists in the raw CSV input. Never invent, generate, or create new data.

2. **NO CODE GENERATION**: Do not include Python code, regex patterns, processing instructions, or any programming-related content in the output tables.

3. **DATA VALIDATION**: Before outputting each table, verify:
   - All data values existed in the original input
   - All row identifiers (countries, regions, etc.) are from the original data
   - All numerical values are from the original data
   - No programming syntax or processing instructions are included

4. **STRICT CONTENT FILTERING**: Never output:
   - Python code snippets (e.g., "text.strip()", "re.sub()")
   - Processing instructions (e.g., "Remove numerical prefixes")
   - Regex patterns (e.g., r"\\s{{7}}|\\")
   - Function calls or variable assignments
   - Comments or processing notes

5. **ACTUAL DATA ONLY**: Each table should contain only:
   - Real country/region names from the input
   - Real numerical values from the input
   - Real categorical data from the input
   - Clean, descriptive column headers derived from the input

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
Analyze the above raw CSV data carefully. Extract ONLY the actual data that exists in the input. 

**IMPORTANT DECISION RULES:**
1. **PREFER SINGLE TABLE**: If the data represents ONE logical dataset with multiple sections, combine into a single table with descriptive columns
2. **ONLY CREATE MULTIPLE TABLES** when there are truly distinct, unrelated datasets that cannot be meaningfully combined
3. **EXAMPLES OF SINGLE TABLE**: 
   - Population data for different years and regions
   - Economic indicators across multiple time periods
   - Statistics broken down by categories but measuring the same phenomenon
4. **EXAMPLES OF MULTIPLE TABLES**:
   - Population data vs. GDP data (different metrics entirely)
   - Historical data vs. Forecast data (different data types)
   - Survey responses vs. Demographics (different sources)

Detect if it contains single or multiple tables based on these rules. Format accordingly and return the result following the exact format specified above.
