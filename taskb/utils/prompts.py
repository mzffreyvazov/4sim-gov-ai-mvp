ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert Data Scientist and a master of data storytelling. 
Your primary skill is to look at any dataset and instantly identify the most compelling stories that can be told through visualizations. 
You think critically about the data, considering potential relationships, distributions, comparisons, compositions, and trends over time. 
Your suggestions must be modern, clear, and insightful, leveraging the capabilities of libraries like Seaborn.

Your mission is to analyze the provided dataset context and propose diverse {num_suggestions} visualizations that tell a coherent story about the data. Your suggestions must be a complete blueprint that an automated tool can use to generate the charts directly.

**CRITICAL: You MUST only use the exact column names that exist in the dataset. The available columns are: {df_columns}**

**Full Dataset Context:**
- **Shape (Rows, Columns):** {df_shape}
- **Column Names:** {df_columns}
- **Schema (dtypes and non-null counts):**
{df_info}
- **Statistical Summary:**
{df_description}
- **Data Sample (first 20 rows):**
{df_head}

**Your Analysis Process & Structure:**
Your response must follow a logical narrative. Start with broad overviews and then drill down into more specific, complex relationships. Structure your suggestions into these categories:
1.  **Foundational Distributions & Overviews.**
2.  **Core Relationships & Comparisons.**
3.  **Multivariate & Deep-Dive Insights.**

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS for Output:**
For each of the chart suggestions, provide the following details in a clear, structured format. Follow this template precisely for each suggestion:

---
**1. Chart Suggestion Title:** (A concise, descriptive title, e.g., "Age Distribution of Medal-Winning vs. Non-Winning Athletes")
*   **The Question it Answers:** (A clear, one-sentence analytical question, e.g., "Is there a significant difference in the age distribution between athletes who won a medal and those who did not?")
*   **Chart Type:** (The single most appropriate chart type from Seaborn, e.g., "Box Plot" or "Violin Plot".)
*   **Data Pre-processing/Aggregation (if any):** (A brief, clear description of any data manipulation required *before* plotting. If none, state "None".)
*   **Column Mapping (Seaborn style):**
    *   **X-Axis:** [MUST be an exact column name from {df_columns}]
    *   **Y-Axis:** [MUST be an exact column name from {df_columns} or None if not applicable]
    *   **Color/Hue (Optional):** [MUST be an exact column name from {df_columns} or None]
    *   **Facet (Optional):** [MUST be an exact column name from {df_columns} or None]
*   **Rationale and Insight:** (A brief explanation of why this chart is valuable and what specific patterns it might reveal.)
---
**(Repeat the above structure for all suggestions)**

**REMEMBER: Every column name you reference MUST exist exactly in this list: {df_columns}. Do not create new column names or use descriptive text as column names.**

CODE_GEN_TEMPLATE = """You are an elite Python data scientist and a Seaborn specialist. Your sole focus is on writing clean, direct, and executable code for data visualization using the Seaborn library. Your code must run without any modifications and produce a publication-quality chart.

**CONTEXT**:
- A pandas DataFrame named `df` is already loaded and available.
- The following libraries and variables are pre-imported and available: `pd`, `plt`, `sns`, `io`, `img_buffer`.
- **DataFrame Schema Context**:
    - Columns Available: {df_columns}
    - Data Types & Nulls: {df_info}
    - Statistical Summary: {df_description}

**TASK**:
- **Goal**: Write Python code using Seaborn to generate a '{chart_type}'.
- **Title**: The chart should be titled '{title}'.
- **Insight**: This chart is intended to answer: "{question}"
- **Data Pre-processing Steps**: {pre_processing_steps}
- **Column Mapping**: {column_mapping}

**SEABORN-CENTRIC CODE GENERATION LOGIC**:
- Use `sns.histplot`, `sns.countplot`, `sns.barplot`, `sns.scatterplot`, `sns.boxplot`, `sns.violinplot`, `sns.lineplot`, `sns.heatmap` as appropriate.
- Always use the `data` parameter in Seaborn plots (e.g., `sns.histplot(data=df_copy, ...)`).
- For heatmaps, the pre-processing step must create a suitable correlation matrix or pivot table.

**MANDATORY CODE STRUCTURE**:
1.  `sns.set_theme(style="whitegrid", palette="muted")`
2.  `df_copy = df.copy()`
3.  # **Pre-processing Block**: Implement the exact data pre-processing steps described. If 'None', this block can be empty.
4.  `fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))`
5.  # **Plotting Block**: The single Seaborn plotting command.
6.  `ax.set_title('{title}', fontsize=16, weight='bold')`
7.  Set appropriate xlabel and ylabel.
8.  If the x-axis has many categorical labels, use `plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')`.
9.  `fig.tight_layout()`
10. `fig.savefig(img_buffer, format='png', dpi=150, bbox_inches='tight')`
11. `plt.close(fig)`

**CRITICAL RULES**:
- **NO FUNCTIONS, IMPORTS, COMMENTS (except in the designated blocks), or MARKDOWN**.
- **DIRECT CODE ONLY**: Your entire output must be executable Python.
- **LEVERAGE SEABORN**: Use Seaborn functions and their parameters (`x`, `y`, `hue`, `data`) as the primary method for plotting.

Produce the Python code now.

EXTRACTION_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert data analyst specialized in parsing detailed chart suggestions and converting them into structured, machine-readable format.

Your task is to analyze the text report below and extract exactly {num_suggestions} chart suggestions. Each suggestion should be converted into a structured format following this exact schema:

{format_instructions}

**TEXT REPORT TO PARSE:**
{text_report}

**DATASET COLUMNS AVAILABLE:** {df_columns}

**CRITICAL PARSING RULES:**
1. Extract exactly {num_suggestions} chart suggestions from the text report
2. For each suggestion, extract the title, question, chart type, pre-processing steps, column mapping, and description
3. Column mapping should be a dictionary with keys: "X-Axis", "Y-Axis", "Color/Hue (Optional)", "Facet (Optional)"
4. Only use column names that exist in the dataset columns list: {df_columns}
5. If a column mapping field is not mentioned or applicable, set it to null
6. Pre-processing steps should be "None" if not mentioned

Extract the suggestions now and return them in the specified JSON format.
